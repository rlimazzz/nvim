For better experience I do suggest to use it with tmux, 3 folders inside plugged are on zip type because it was too big to put on github. I hope you enjoy my vim configuration :) 
The code is from many sources on the internet that I took to get a better final product, feel free to modify as your demand request!! 
The f2 configuration to save is because I'm too tired to press esc and type :w to save everytime hahahaha
